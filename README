This is a wrapper for the Android libhtc_ril.so which intercepts all command
traffic between the library and the cell modem for logging. The log messages
can be retrieved using "logcat -b radio".

The wrapper has two pieces: the shared library, and a helper program. Both
of these files should be installed in /system/lib. As installed, things must
look like this:

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          5340 Mar 27 10:25 /system/lib/libhtc_rilspy.so
-rwsr-x---    1 root     radio         5388 Mar 27 10:17 /system/lib/rilspy_helper

That is, the helper program must be owned by root, group radio, and setuid root.

To invoke it, edit /system/build.prop and change the rild property:

#rild.libpath=/system/lib/libhtc_ril.so
rild.libpath=/system/lib/libhtc_rilspy.so

(Comment out the old one and add the new one)

Then reboot.
